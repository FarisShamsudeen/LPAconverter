Ever wondered how much **LPA (Lacs Per Annum)** salaries translate into different countries? Struggled with converting **LPA to monthly salary** or vice versa?  

I searched for a tool like this and found **nothing**—so I built one! 🚀  

## ✨ Features  

✔️ **Convert INR salaries** to multiple currencies: USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CAD, AUD, CNY, and more!  
✔️ **Fetches real-time exchange rates** for accuracy 📈  
✔️ **Applies country-specific tax slabs** to estimate post-tax income 🏦  
✔️ **Perfect for job seekers, freelancers, and global professionals** 🌍
